_Chain Reaction_ is based on
[_goodluck_](https://github.com/piesku/goodluck/generate), a hackable
template for creating small and fast browser games. It's a Canvas2D game
written in a strict ECS architecture.

_Chain Reaction_ is meant as a resource for:

  - learning how to think in code,
  - learning the basics of JavaScript,
  - learning how to create games.
